abstract: |
  A key component of linguistic knowledge is the capacity to form and identify novel combinations of word stems and affixes, e.g., googleable (google + able). Behavioral and electrophysiological studies demonstrate that morphologically complex words are processed by initially decomposing them into their constituent parts, known as the EARLY FORM BASED DECOMPOSITION stage. Followed by morphological RECOMPOSITION which involves two distinct stages: checking the syntactic category of the stem followed by evaluating its semantic interpretation. Earlier reseach has focused primarily in verbal domain using derivational affixes. This study examines the visual word recognition of complex words in Bangla/ Bengali focusing on the derivational prefixes.
plain-language-summary: |
  Nominal prefixes in Bangla show reverse effects.
key-points:
  - Reversal of violation effects
  - Right Hemisphere analogues
